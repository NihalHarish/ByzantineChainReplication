Test case 1 has been modified to incorporate forwarded_requests

one of the replicas changes the operation
the client then forwards messages as retransmission
So do the the other replicas
that will trigger forwarded requests 

To make forwarded request work, we trigger the change operation at head. 
That will lead to inconsistent result at the next replica.
Coz the state of hash will be different from the operation he performed
